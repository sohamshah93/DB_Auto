# DB_Auto
This is an application to automate ticket booking on the Deutsche Bahn Website. It works by using the selenium library to book ticket closest to the desired time of travel.

The application works by entering the desired Origin and Destination station, Date and Time of Travel. Class of travel and the Login details can be included to directly proceed to payment options. Selecting the book now option will complete all the booking stages and move to the payment page option. A price check option is also available without the need to enter Login details.

The payment options are to be entered by the user for security reasons. Although this process can also be automated in the future.
